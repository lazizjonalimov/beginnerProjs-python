Random Number Guess Project: 
  - Requires a user input, with a total number of attempts of 10. 
  - If user cannot guess a number within the maximum number attempts, then the loop terminates and the user loses. 
  - If the user guesses the number, he/she wins. 
 When playing the game and guessing the wrong number, the user gets the necessary hints starting from the first wrong attempt.
