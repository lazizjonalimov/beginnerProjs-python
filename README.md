The Beginners Projects Repository is going to consist of the many small-scale projects I have completed so far using Python Programming Language. 
  All the projects are going to have the explanation part marked with their number and name. 

1. Random Guess Number - this project randomly generates a number between 1 and 100, and requires a user to input an integer within these numbers
  - There is a limit set to 10 attempts. 
  - If user continues to input the wrong number and the total number of attempts reaches 10, then the loop terminates - user loses the game. 
  - If enter a corrent number that is equal to the secret number generated by the computer, then the user WINS. 
  - When giving a wrong input, user is given a number of hints, including whether the number is prime, odd, or even. 
  - Also it gives a message saying whether the user gave a too low, or too high number guess.
